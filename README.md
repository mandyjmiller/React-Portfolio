## Installation

As a website user, there are no installation requirements. The Web page can be viewed using most web browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari etc.

As a developer, there are some additional installation steps:

generate a starter React app using Vite. You can do this by running `npm create vite@latest wheelz -- --template react`. .

* Once you have a `wheelz ` React app generated, cd into your application's directory and run `npm install` to install the base dependencies.

* Once everything has been installed, delete the `src` folder inside of your starter app and replace it with the [src] provided with this project

* Start the app by running `npm run dev` in your terminal and then take a moment to study the HTML code being rendered in the browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Ensure Bootstrap and other paackages are installed using the following:

* npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/core

* npm install --save react-fontawesome
